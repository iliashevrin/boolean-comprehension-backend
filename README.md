# boolean-comprehension-backend
This is the backend node project of the experimental framework described in the paper "What Properties Affect Boolean Formula Comprehension in Formal Specifications?" (TOSEM 2025).
# Running and Testing
To run the backend locally on port 8000, clone it into your machine and run `npm run dev`.

The project was deployed during the experiment execution as a Render project and served at [https://boolean-formula-comprehension.onrender.com](https://boolean-formula-comprehension.onrender.com). Parallelly, the corresponding frontend at [https://github.com/iliashevrin/boolean-comprehension-frontend](https://github.com/iliashevrin/boolean-comprehension-frontend) was deployed as a vercel project and served at [https://boolean-formula-comprehension-front.vercel.app/](https://boolean-formula-comprehension-front.vercel.app/).
